## Hi, I am Tanjir Antu.

I am a professional software engineer with 4 years of full-stack development experience. Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB as the database are my primary tools, but I am technology agnostic.

I am experienced optimizing front-end applications. I have been using React.js, Next.js, Redux for building performant web apps. I am familiar with AWS EC2, S3, Cloudfront, Cloudflare, Nginx, Docker, CI/CD tools like Jenkins etc.

I love to work with cutting-edge technologies. Love to learn and study System Design.

##### Tools & Technologies I used:

-   TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, C#
-   GraphQL, Rest API
-   MongoDB, MySQL, MSSQL, Radis, Socket.IO
-   Git, Jenkins CI/CD, Docker, AWS, Nginx, Cloudflare
